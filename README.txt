Introduction
============

The "subjects" field for Dexterity content types in Plone 4.3.x uses a naive textarea widget.

This package uses the Select2 Javascript library (which is included with Plone 5) to create a useful keyword widget.

Install as usual; activate in Plone as usual.

Select2 4.x is included in this package. Select2 is licensed under the MIT license. Other portions of the package are licensed under the GPLv2.
